Common

Common is a collection of common algorithms and functions. The code is public domain so feel free to use it as you like - attribution is not necessary but always appreciated :-)

<!-- 
One of these gives you a "Report Card" of your code.  Linting, a complexity measure, ... 
The other of these shows your code in a package directory for other people to find it. 
Let's wait until we get the paths changed over entirely, and then see how it looks. 
The package index at least seems to require an extra step to get one's package registered.
